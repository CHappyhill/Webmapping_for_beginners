## Workshop

The workshop can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki).

## Presentation

This workshop will start with a [presentation](https://nieneb.github.io/Webmapping_for_beginners/) to introduce the basic concepts that are needed to do this workshop. 

## Short outline of the workshop

JavaScript powers most on-line maps these days. During this workshop we'll cover the two primary mapping libraries D3.js and Leaflet.js. This workshop will start from the very beginning! Never written a line of code before? Don't worry! This workshop will help get you started. 
Therefore we'll start off with a brief introduction into making web pages in general. To eventually spend most of our time on learning the tools of the trade.

1. First we will introduce Leaflet in the [Introduction Leaflet](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/Introduction-Leaflet).
2. If you are not comfortable with HTML and CSS the [Making a Web Page](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/Making-a-web-page) tutorial will get you started.
3. In [Leaflet step 1](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/Leaflet-step-1) we will set up the basics to show a standard background map with Leaflet.
4. In [Leaflet step 2](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/Leaflet-step-2) we will add markers, circles and polygons to our map.
5. In [Leaflet step 3](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/Leaflet-step-3) we will add a GeoJSON file containing geo-spatial data to our map.
5. Get familiar with D3 in [Introduction D3](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/Introduction-D3).
6. In [D3 step 1](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/D3-step-1) we will set up the basics to show a simple world map with D3.
7. In [D3 step 2](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/D3-step-2) we will add extra data from a GeoJSON file to our map and style it based on data attributes. 
8. In [D3 step 3](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/D3-step-3) we will add a data-driven legend to our webpage. 
9. Eventually we will put our maps online, with [Hosting on Github](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/Hosting-on-github)
10. Do you have time left? Have a look at the [Leaflet Advanced](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki/Leaflet-advanced) or [[D3 Advanced]] exercises.

## Goal 

At the end of this workshop, you will have your own web page with an interactive map! Including some custom data and different background maps, zoomed in on the area you want to show! Your web page will be hosted on Github, so you can immediately share your progress of the day with all your family and friends!

## Beginners

For beginners means: if you have NO knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Leaflet.js and D3.js, this workshop will help you get started!


## What do you need?

Your laptop with:

* a web browser, like Firefox, Chrome or Safari.
* a proper text editor, like [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) with [Syntax Highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting).
* a Github account. Create one at [www.github.com](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).
* internet.

>### Syntax Highlighting
>
> Syntax highlighting is a feature of text editors that are used for programming, scripting, or mark-up languages, such as HTML. It displays text, especially source code, in different colours and fonts according to the category of terms to make them more visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.
