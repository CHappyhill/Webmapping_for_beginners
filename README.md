# Maptime #9 Leaflet & D3 workshop

Come code your maps with us at the next Maptime Amsterdam!

The team from Webmapper will provide a workshop to share their hands-on experience in web cartography and geographic web application development.

JavaScript powers most online maps these days. During this evening we'll cover the two primary mapping libraries D3.js and Leaflet.js .

We'll start off with an overview of some of the best maps of 2015 made with JavaScript, to give you an insight into the versatility of JavaScript for maps. Followed by a brief introduction of the tools of the trade.

After a short break to take in some Dutch courage, we'll start the workshop. Never written a line of code before? Don't worry! Maptime is for all skill levels! This is what Maptime is all about: a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation.

During the workshop, we create an interactive, online map together taking one step at a time! So bring your Laptop to join in.

Are you already a seasoned Web developer or geo-specialist well versed in the ins and outs of JavaScript, don't be put off: also for you there might be new inspiration. If printed maps is more your cup of tea, D3 and leaflet are also great tools to prepare your paper maps!
