# Workshop Webmapping for Beginners

For the workshop can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/NieneB/Webmapping_for_beginners/wiki).

The team from [Webmapper](http://www.webmapper.nl "What the map can be") developed this workshop to share their hands-on experience in web cartography and geographic web application development
JavaScript powers most on-line maps these days. During this evening we'll cover the two primary mapping libraries [D3.js](http://d3js.org/ "Data Driven Documents") and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/ "a JavaScript library
for interactive maps").

We'll start off with an overview of some of the best maps of 2016 made with JavaScript, to give you an insight into the versatility of JavaScript for maps. Followed by a brief introduction of the tools of the trade.

After a short break to take in some Dutch courage, we'll start the workshop. Never written a line of code before? Don't worry! Maptime is for all skill levels! This is what Maptime is all about: a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation.


### Beginners

If you want to get the most out of the workshop and want to prepare yourself, you could take a look at the JavaScript and HTML & CSS tutorials on [Code Academy](www.codecademy.com). (Nice and free) Sign in on www.codecademy.com Doing the introduction lessons for all 3 languages is sufficient!

During the workshop we will take you step by step through the processes.
